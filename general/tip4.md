# Decentralized Governance

On-chain governance is a system for managing and implementing changes to cryptocurrency blockchains. In this type of governance, rules for instituting changes are encoded into the blockchain protocol. Developers propose changes through code updates and each node votes on whether to accept or reject the proposed change.

### Type of blockchain governance

Governance in blockchain is done in two ways such as:

- Off-chain Blockchain governance first emerged as an off-chain process in which stakeholders coordinated and determined the direction of a protocol through conferences, mailing lists, online forums, and other means. However, off-chain systems often result in situations where some stakeholders are more powerful than others. In the Bitcoin ecosystem, for example, core developers and miners wield the most power because more casual users lack the formal means to register their input.

- On-chain governance, a mechanism that enables stakeholders to vote for protocol changes directly on the blockchain, was developed to provide individual users with more influence in the governance process. In this system, governance proposals are often coded into smart contracts and are executed if they receive the required amount of votes to be ratified. DeFi platforms largely use on-chain governance mechanisms. To earn the right to vote or to make a proposal, you typically must hold a governance token. Though on-chain governance has proven to be significantly user-inclusive, it has also been criticized as plutocratic, because the amount of tokens you hold often determines the weight of your vote.
