<h3> What is an NFT ? </h3>
<hr />
<p>A Non-Fungible Token, also known as a NFT, is a type of digital token or asset. When you buy an NFT, you are buying the rights to that specific asset. 

"Non-Fungible" means that it is unique and can't be replaced with something else. For example, the dollar is fungible â€” trade one dollar for another dollar, and you'll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card you'd have something completely different.

NFTS are best understood as unique digital assets, and they exist in a variety of industries from digital art and virtual real estate to collectibles gaming and more. Basically, any type of media can be minted or tokenized and turned into an NFT art: trading cards, memes, GIFs, video clips, audio clips, tweets, etc.

<h3>What does it mean to mint an NFT?</h3>
<hr />
<p>To mint or minting an NFT refers to the process of executing the transaction. By doing so, we assign a particular digital file and other parameters we determine to an NFT. All this data gets written in a particular block of the blockchain ledger and thus becomes metadata.
